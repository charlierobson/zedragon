# zedragon
Conversion of Russ Wetmore's classic Atari game Sea Dragon for the Sinclair ZX81 suitably equipped with 32K RAM, AY/YM sound and UDG.ยง

## How to play

Avoid contact with enemies or the environment. Don't run out of air. Surface regularly to refill your tanks.

ZXpand joystick or the following keys move your sub:

|Key|Direction|
|----|----|
| Q | Up |
| A | Down |
| N | Left |
| M | Right |

Space fires. Hold fire while moving to slow the sub's movement for tight spots.

### BUGS
* ~~ship parts left behind when reversing~~
* ~~explosion parts left behind sometimes~~
* ~~crash when ship goes into line 9~~
* ~~chain sometimes doesn't fall~~
* ~~laser graphically interferes with bullet~~
* ~~sub collisions broken~~
* ~~enemies can fall below line 10~~
* ~~torpedo passes through mine sometimes~~
* ~~sub exploding on line 9 crashes the game~~
* controls get stuck sometimes
  * not sure if this is a ZXpand issue, nature of input fns is that they *will* clear if left alone...

### NICE TO HAVE
* control customisation
* other udg boards
* chroma
* sound on/off
* game over music
